# Grand Theft Auto Used Cars
#### "Where every car is a steal"

 ## Tabels:  
*  customer  
*  sales_person 
*  mechanic
*  sales_car 
*  customer_car
*  part
*  service
*  invoice
*  service_ticket
*  history
 
## Functions
* addCustomer 
This function allows you to quickly add a new customer by putting their first and last name in
*  addServiceTicket
This function allows you to quickly create a new service ticket for a customer You must put in total cost, vin, service_id, and the part_id. Of course since you dont always need a full service or a part both of those can be ommited. 


### Logic
My logic for my data base here is that a customer can have many cars and can buy many cars but a car can only belong to one user  
For every car sold one invoice is made.  
Many services are offered and are kept track of for customer and buisness purposes.
